Welcome to my Minecraft Custom Server Plugin/Mod Project!

This Repo is private as to not release anything internal to players that will be using the server/plugin. Please do not share this to anyone!

All code here is written by me. The objective of this custom plugin/mod/server is to sort of recreate the game "Chivalry" inside of minecraft, but with a twist. I used
the PaperMC API and some small libraries to help me achieve this.
